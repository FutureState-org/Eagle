      There are 3 conceptions of the rule of law which had been highlighted by Dicey. The first aspect indicates that no
      man
      is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or deprived of their goods unless they had violated the
      law
      which has been established in an ordinary way and applied by an ordinary court. There is also an absolute
      supremacy
      or
      predominance of regular law over arbitrary power and the state could not act in an arbitrary manner which was
      unlawful.
    </p>
    <p class="para_info">
      The second aspect of Dicey’s conception of the rule of law indicates that in terms of the equality before the law,
      no
      man is above the law. Regardless of what an individual’s rank or condition is, he is subjected to the ordinary law
      of
      the realm and be bounded to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals. As a result, no matter an ordinary private
      citizen or a state official breached the same law, they would be treated in the same way. It denoted that the
      state
      officials were not given any special privileges or protections from the law of the land. Thomas Fuller had also
      quoted
      that “Be you ever so high, the law is above you.”

    <p class="para_info">
      The third aspect denotes that the principles of the constitution are
      the result of the ordinary law of the land. Dicey stated that Britain had a court-based constitution (in effect, a
      common law constitution), in the sense that decisions made by the judges directly resulted the principles of the
      constitution which concerning the rights of private persons. This reveals Dicey’s belief that the common law
      affords
      greater protection to the citizens than a written constitution.
